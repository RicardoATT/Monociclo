# Bubble sort simulation

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you want to run another set of instructions, perform the same simulation setup steps.

By default, the project has implemented the bubble sort algorithm with RISC-V instruction in a *.hex* file. To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Click on the *Settings* option in the *Assignments* tab.

5. Write the names and check the boxes seen in the image. In the *End simulation at* section write *100* and select the *ps* option. Then, click on the button marked in black.

6. Select the path where the project was saved and choose the directory of the black box. Select the *.vt* file and open it.

7.
